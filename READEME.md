# Curriculum Project Manager

A Firebase app that helps us create our curriculum at UCode

## Using the application

The app is hosted by Firebase. It can be accessed here: https://curriculum-project-manager.firebaseapp.com/

Accounts can only be created through the Firebase console, for now.

## Developing

I'm not accepting contributions at the moment

## Building / Deploying

There are no files to build yet. The app should be deployed to Firebase, using the Firebase command

```shell
firebase deploy
```

You'll need to be logged into my Google account to run this command

## Licensing
